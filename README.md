Users have the ability to search to filter or sort upcoming hosted games...

We clearly show which events are virtual...

and 

which are in-person...

In the dashboard page, users have views to their profile card with the ability to edit...

Hosts can clearly see all of their events with the default card being the closest event being hosted to the actual date.

Our Create Event Form is also easy for the user to provide their details and submit...

Events can also be updated or deleted by Hosts at any time...

We included an about us page and once the user clicks 'Logout' they will be required to log back in should they decide to create a new event or join another one.
